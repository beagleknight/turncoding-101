===========================

Experimental game development turn-based between @ReikVal and @beagleknight.

How to build the project
------------------------

* `npm install -g gulp`
* `npm rebuild`
* `gulp                # Start server listening on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080)`

Project's folder structure
--------------------------

* **src/js**: Script source files
* **src/css**: Style source files
* **public**: Web root folder and generated styles and scripts.

Rules
-----

* You CANNOT develop anything if it's not your turn (see TURN.md).
* You CAN refactor existing code if it doesn't change old features.
* Develop small features to improve the existing game.
* There is not a game design or plan. Just develop what you want.
* When you have finished change TURN.md with your partner's name.
* Enjoy!
